Lojban has many gismu about emotional states, but I've always found it difficult to express nuances (e.g. "alert" vs "excited", or "nervous" vs "tense", etc), and some emotions are missing entirely.

I found this list on wikipedia (quite a few of these are gismu, but not all):
Affection
Anger
Angst
Anguish
Annoyance
Anxiety
Apathy
Arousal
Awe
Boredom
Confidence
Contempt
Contentment
Courage
Curiosity
Depression
Desire
Despair
Disappointment
Disgust
Distrust
Dread
Ecstasy
Embarrassment
Envy
Euphoria
Excitement
Fear
Frustration
Gratitude
Grief
Guilt
Happiness
Hatred
Hope
Horror
Hostility
Hurt
Hysteria
Indifference
Interest
Jealousy
Joy
Loathing
Loneliness
Love
Lust
Outrage
Panic
Passion
Pity
Pleasure
Pride
Rage
Regret
Relief
Remorse
Sadness
Satisfaction
Self-confidence
Shame
Shock
Shyness
Sorrow
Suffering
Surprise
Terror
Trust
Wonder
Worry
Zeal
Zest

There are also different categorizations of emotions, for example

and

I'd be very happy if we could work something out.

I'd definitely like to have a bunch of gismu like  "x1 is excited about x2".

I'm also missing certain "manners", like "gentle" or "careful":
- x1 does activity x2 (ka) gently
- x1 carefully does x2 (ka); x1 is careful in doing x2 (ka)"

Those might need to be discussed in a different thread. Words like {suksa} and {vlile} would fall into the "manner" category and would need adjustments (if {suksa} is "x1 suddenly x2 (ka)" then {vlile} as "x1 violently x2 (ka)" makes sense (again this would not really break usage, as the x2 can just be {lo ka fasnu} for old usage). also {fenki}, {racli}, ...
