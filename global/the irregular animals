Situation:
There are four animal gismu with an irregular x3. These are: tirxu, vidru, lanme, and civla.

Proposal:
Remove the x3 of those words to make all the animals equal. 

Impact:
Usage breakage is imperceptible. The corpus shows zero uses of tirxu3 and 5 vidru3, and all the 5 lanme3 uses are jokes and insults. civla3 has 10 results, again including meta-jokes at the place structure.
Gimste becomes more regular. These gismu places are common targets of ridicule.
