Let's make a global decision about the color gismu. Here are my questions:

1) Are there any current color gismu that need changing? Some change in the wording? Let's make sure that they are all okay (they probably are, but maybe some of them can be made even clearer)
2) Are any colors missing? Please see this page: http://www.lojban.org/tiki/tiki-index.php?page=new%20color%20gismu
It states: "We already have nine color gismu, RGB and CMY along with brown, white, black, and gray.
We also have violet (a tertiary color) and orange (also tertiary). My opinion is that if we have two tertiary colors (four if you count gray and brown) then we should have all six (or eight)" 

Opinions?
